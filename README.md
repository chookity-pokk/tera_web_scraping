# Python Script to grab a CSV from the G&D Chillers Tera Portal

Steps to complete the script:
- login to website listed as `url` in the script.
- set username/password in the script or pull it from a seperate script for slightly more security.
- then adjust url to where you need to be to avoid have to click on a bunch of buttons.
- lastly click on the button you need to click on to download whatever it is you want to download with `.click()`
Make sure to put some `sleep()` steps in between if the website is slow or if the internet is slow.
